# exFat forensic basic info gathering
This is python script I made as I'm learning basics of exFat filesystem forensics at work.

Check Main function to see implemented commands and coresponding functions.

## What it can do?
* Gather and print VBR information;
* Print cluster status based on bitmap position (absolute byte position);
* Carve data out into file by defining the start and the end clusters.
